            <h3>About me in this projects</h3>
            <h3>I was mainly concerned with programming, creating mechanics, systems and AI. The theme of the project was chosen because of the required ai opponents I wanted to focus on. I had used Behaviour Tree before but wanted to learn more, I experimented a lot in that direction. I learned and applied EQS, which allowed me to vary with the behaviour of fleeing opponents and tracking the player, in a more consistent rather than random way, I applied Events to attacks that could be performed for longer or shorter periods of time.
                I used universal Tasks that I could use for several opponents without duplicating similar behaviours. I also learned about Detectors, - - -.
